* viola works great for running notebooks as webapp: https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deploy.html#setup-an-example-project
* DEPRECATED: https://mybinder.org easy setup and sharing, but ~10 second startup times for cold starts.
* DONE: heroku is easy
* DONE: heroku basic deploy size limit 500 mb (current project req size 630 mb).
* DONE: research heroku docker containter deploy no size limits, not sure about cold starts.
* ISSUE: app in docker uses too much memory
* NOT NEEDED: research repo2docker to _easily_ convert repo to docker container https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
